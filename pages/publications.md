A commentary focused on the issue of whether microbiome data can help address the issue of 'missing heritability'. In contrast to several recent articles, we argue that it would be inappropriate to consider microbial genetic variation in the human microbiome as an extension of the human genome. We then describe several approaches by which microbiome data could be used (given further evaluation) as a proxy for environmental variation in genome-wide association studies.

An updated method for metagenome prediction based on amplicon sequences. We describe the updated steps in PICRUSt2 and also several new validation approaches that give an improved picture of how well metagenome prediction approaches perform. These improved validation approaches include computing the concordance expected by chance between predicted and actual metagenomes and also evaluating how similar the results of differential abundance testing are between the actual and predicted metagenome profiles.

<div style="padding-left: 30px;">
A review paper describing the diverse set of approaches that have been developed for identifying horizontal gene transfer events in metagenomes and in isolate genomes. We contrast these approaches and describe particular cases where they have been applied. We emphasize the challenges for detecting horizontal gene transfer specifically in metagenomes data and highlight bioinformatics approaches developed to address these challenges. We close by describing several new technological advances that will likely greatly improve the performance of most bioinformatics approaches that we describe.
