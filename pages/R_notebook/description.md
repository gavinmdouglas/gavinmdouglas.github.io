Below is the [R markdown code]({{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/R_notebook/code_example.html) and [HTML output](({{ BASE_PATH }}/pages/R_notebook/example.html)) of an example R notebook. I created these files to showcase some basic features and to be a reference for R notebook features that I find especially useful. Further description is found within the HTML output itself.
