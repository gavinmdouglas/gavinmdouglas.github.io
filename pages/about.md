I am a PhD candidate in the department of Microbiology and Immunology at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada) in [Dr Morgan Langille's research lab](http://morganlangille.com).

My research mainly focuses on how to best analyze microbiome sequencing data. I am also deeply interested in questions in evolutionary genetics and more recently the relationship between biology and law.
