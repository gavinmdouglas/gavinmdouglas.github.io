I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Jesse Shapiro's lab](http://www.shapirolab.ca/) at McGill University (Montréal, Québec, Canada). Prior to starting this position I was a PhD student in Microbiology and Immunology in [Morgan Langille's research lab](http://morganlangille.com) at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada).

My current research focuses on investigating the evolutionary forces shaping microbial pangenome structure. I am using several bioinformatics approaches to investigate this general question, including shotgun metagenomics sequencing data from the honey bee gut microbiome.

My PhD thesis focused on developing improved bioinformatics methods for analyzing microbiome sequencing data.

My past research also involved developing and applying bioinformatics approaches to investigate agricultural and evolutionary genetics questions. I am also deeply interested in science policy and new ways to improve scientific publishing.
