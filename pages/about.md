I am a postdoctoral researcher in [Jesse Shapiro's lab](http://www.shapirolab.ca/) at McGill University (Montréal, Québec, Canada). Prior to starting this position I was a PhD student in Microbiology and Immunology in [Morgan Langille's research lab](http://morganlangille.com) at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada).

In addition to doing research, I am also very interested in the steps downstream of research. Specifically, I am deeply interested in science publishing and science policy. I am enjoying exploring this space as the 2022-2023 Co-President of [Science & Policy Exchange](https://www.sp-exchange.ca) (a volunteer-run, non-profit, headquartered in Montréal).

My current research focuses on investigating the evolutionary forces shaping microbial pangenome structure. I am using several bioinformatics approaches to investigate this general question, including shotgun metagenomics sequencing data from the honey bee gut microbiome.

My [PhD thesis](https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/handle/10222/80086) focused on developing improved bioinformatics methods for analyzing microbiome sequencing data.

My past research also involved developing and applying bioinformatics approaches to investigate agricultural and evolutionary genetics questions.
