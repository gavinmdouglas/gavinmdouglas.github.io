			I am a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="http://www.shapirolab.ca">Jesse Shapiro's lab</a> at McGill University (Montréal, Québec, Canada). Prior to starting this position I was a PhD student in Microbiology and Immunology in <a href="http://morganlangille.com">Morgan Langille's research lab</a> at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada).
<br/><br/>
			In addition to doing research, I am also very interested in the steps downstream of research. Specifically, I am deeply interested in science publishing and science policy. I am enjoying exploring this space as the 2022-2023 Co-President of <a href="https://www.sp-exchange.ca">Science & Policy Exchange</a> (a volunteer-run, non-profit, headquartered in Montréal).
<br/><br/>
			My current research focuses on investigating the evolutionary forces shaping microbial pangenome structure. I am using several bioinformatics approaches to investigate this general question, including shotgun metagenomics sequencing data from the honey bee gut microbiome.
<br/><br/>
			My <a href="https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/handle/10222/80086">PhD thesis</a> focused on developing improved bioinformatics methods for analyzing microbiome sequencing data.
<br/><br/>
			My past research also involved developing and applying bioinformatics approaches to investigate agricultural and evolutionary genetics questions.
