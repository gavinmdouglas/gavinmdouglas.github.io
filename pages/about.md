			I am a postdoctoral researcher in <a href="https://louismariebobay.wixsite.com/bobaylab">Louis-Marie Bobay's lab</a> at North Carolina State University (Raleigh, North Carolina, USA). My previous postdoctoral work was with <a href="http://www.shapirolab.ca">Jesse Shapiro</a> at McGill University (Montréal, Québec, Canada). I did my PhD in Microbiology and Immunology with <a href="http://morganlangille.com">Morgan Langille</a> at Dalhousie University (Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada).
<br/><br/>
			In addition to doing research, I am also very interested in the steps downstream of research. Specifically, I am deeply interested in science publishing reform, which I contribute to as a Managing Board Member <a href="https://genomics.peercommunityin.org/">Peer Community in Genomics</a>. I also enjoy exploring the science policy space, which I did most prominently as the 2022-2023 Co-President of <a href="https://www.sp-exchange.ca">Science & Policy Exchange</a> (a volunteer-run, non-profit, headquartered in Montréal).
<br/><br/>
			My current research focuses on investigating the evolutionary forces shaping microbial pangenome structure. I am using several bioinformatics approaches to investigate this general question, including shotgun metagenomics sequencing data from the honey bee gut microbiome.
<br/><br/>
			My <a href="https://dalspace.library.dal.ca/handle/10222/80086">PhD thesis</a> focused on developing improved bioinformatics methods for analyzing microbiome sequencing data.
<br/><br/>
			My past research also involved developing and applying bioinformatics approaches to investigate agricultural and evolutionary genetics questions.
